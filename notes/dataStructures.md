# Data Structures

Data structures are a fundamental piece to writing efficient code. There are hundreds of data structures in the worlds. Here are some major examples we will cover:

- Binary Search Trees
- Queues
- Priority Queues
- Singly Linked Lists
- Doubly Linked Lists
- Undirected Unweighted Graphs
- Directed Graphs
- Binary Heaps
- Hash Tables
- Stacks

## What do they do?

Data structures are collections of values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data. An array is a basic data structure available in most all programming languages.

## Why are there so many?

Different data structures excel at different things. Some are highly specialized, while others (like arrays) are more generally used.

## Why Care?

The more time you spend as a developer, the more likely you'll need to use one of these data structures. You've already worked with many of them unknowingly, like the DOM (a tree). And of course, they are used in **interviews**.

**There is no BEST data structure.** They all excel in different situations.

- Working with map/location data?  Use a **graph**.
- Need an ordered list with fast inserts/removals at the beginning and end?  Use a **linked list**.
- Web scraping nested HTML?  Use a **tree**.
- Need to write a scheduler?  Use a **binary heap**.
