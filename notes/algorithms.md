# Algorithms & Problem Solving

## What is an algorithm?

A process or set of steps to accomplish a certain task.

## Problem Solving Techniques

### How do you improve?

1. **Devise** a plan for solving problems.
2. **Master** common problem solving patterns.

#### What is the plan?

1. **Understand The Problem**
   1. Can I restate the problem in my own words?
   2. What are the inputs that go into the problem?
   3. What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?
   4. Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? Do I have enough information to solve the problem?
   5. How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?
2. **Explore Concrete Examples**
   1. Coming up with examples can help you understand the problem better.
   2. Examples also provide sanity checks that your eventual solution works how it should.
   3. User stories.
   4. Unit tests.
   5. Start simply, then progress to more complex examples, then move onto edge cases.
   6. Explore empty and invalid inputs.
3. **Break It Down**
   1. Add in comments for each step of the problem. Explicitly write out the steps to take. Start with major items, then fill in the blanks.
   2. Forces you to think about the code you'll write before you write it, and helps catch any lingering conceptual issues or misunderstandings before diving in.
   3. Helps to communicate the thought process of how you're approaching the problem to the interviewers.
4. **Solve Or Simplify**
   1. Solve the problem if you can, and if you can't, solve a simpler problem.
   2. Try and ignore the part(s) that are giving you a hard time, and focus on the other parts.
   3. It's much better to end the problem with something to show at minimum. The more, the better.
   4. Find the core difficulty in what you're trying to do, temporarily ignore it, write a simplified solution, then implement it back into your solution.
5. **Look Back And Refactor**
   1. After solving the problem, it's not complete. You can often get by with something that works, but in an interview, it helps to show that you strive for improvement.
   2. Can you check the result? Does it work?
   3. Can you derive the result differently?
   4. Can you understand it at a glance?
   5. Can you use the result or method for some other problem?
   6. Can you improve the performance of your solution, i.e. time/space complexity?
   7. Can you think of other ways to refactor, i.e. aesthetics, neatness, naming conventions, etc?
   8. How have other people solved this problem? Ask this question for interviewers.
